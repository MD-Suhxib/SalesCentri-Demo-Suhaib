Questionnaire Changes Specification (Based on Growth Strategy Matrix)
1. Objective

Refactor the existing questionnaire to be strategy-driven, based on the 4-quadrant growth framework shown in the first screenshot (Customers × Products matrix).

The questionnaire must:

Identify the user’s growth strategy first

Adapt questions dynamically based on that strategy

Align UI labels, logic, and outputs with the selected quadrant

2. Growth Strategy Framework (Source of Truth)

The questionnaire must be based on the following 4 Growth Strategies:

Quadrant	Customers	Products	Strategy Name
Q1	New	Existing	New Customer Acquisition
Q2	Existing	Existing	Revenue Optimization (Order More)
Q3	Existing	New	Upsell / Expansion
Q4	New	New	New Market Entry

This framework must drive question flow, copy, and results.

3. New Section: Strategy Selection (Mandatory First Step)
Section Name

Growth Strategy Identification

Purpose

Determine which quadrant the user belongs to before any numeric inputs.

Question

“What best describes your current growth goal?”

Options (Must map 1-to-1 to quadrants)

A. Grow revenue from existing customers using current offerings → Q2

B. Acquire new customers using current offerings → Q1

C. Sell new products / upgrades to existing customers → Q3

D. Enter new markets with new products → Q4

Output

Store selected value as:

growth_strategy = Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4

4. Questionnaire Flow Changes (Dynamic Branching)

After strategy selection, only relevant questions should be shown.

Q1 – New Customer Acquisition (New Customers + Existing Product)

Goal: Predict lead generation and sales performance.

Required Questions

Revenue target (monthly or annual)

Number of leads needed per month

Monthly acquisition budget

Number of deals to be closed per month

Primary industry

Notes

Current questionnaire mostly fits Q1

Keep all numeric performance questions

Q2 – Revenue Optimization (Existing Customers + Existing Product)

Goal: Increase revenue from current customer base.

Replace / Add Questions

Number of active customers

Average order value (AOV)

Purchase frequency per customer

Retention or churn rate

Revenue growth target

Remove

Lead generation questions

New customer acquisition metrics

Q3 – Upsell / Expansion (Existing Customers + New Product)

Goal: Expand revenue via add-ons, upgrades, or cross-sell.

Questions

Existing customer base size

Upsell / upgrade price

Estimated attach or adoption rate

Sales cycle length

Revenue target from expansion

Notes

Focus on expansion efficiency, not lead volume

Q4 – New Market Entry (New Customers + New Product)

Goal: Assess readiness and risk for new market entry.

Questions

Target market or segment

Primary industry

Sales motion (Outbound / Inbound / PLG / Partners)

Monthly budget allocation

Timeframe to revenue expectations

Notes

More qualitative inputs allowed

Fewer performance assumptions

5. UI / Copy Alignment Changes
Left-Side Visual (Circle Section)

Must dynamically update based on:

Selected growth strategy

Current step in that strategy

Examples:

“Revenue Growth – New Customer Acquisition”

“Expansion Revenue – Upsell Strategy”

Progress Indicator

Replace generic progress with:

Step X of Y – [Strategy Name]


Example:

Step 2 of 5 – New Customer Acquisition

6. Final Results Screen (Required Change)
Must Display

Detected Growth Strategy

Primary Business Objective

Key Bottleneck

Recommended Focus Area

Example Output
Growth Strategy: New Customer Acquisition
Primary Bottleneck: Lead Volume
Recommended Focus: Paid Acquisition + Sales Automation


The final output must explicitly reference the strategy quadrant.

7. Technical Rules

Strategy selection is mandatory

All subsequent questions must be conditional

No single static questionnaire for all users

Strategy logic must be reusable and extensible

8. Definition of Done

The questionnaire is complete when:

Strategy is identified in Step 1

Question flow changes per strategy

UI language matches the growth framework

Final output clearly maps back to the quadrant
